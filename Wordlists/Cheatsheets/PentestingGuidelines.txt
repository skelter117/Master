1.	Pre-engagement: This phase involves defining the scope, goals, and rules of engagement for the penetration test. It includes establishing communication channels, obtaining necessary permissions, and agreeing on the testing timeline.

2.	Reconnaissance: This step involves gathering information about the target organization, its infrastructure, systems, and employees. Reconnaissance can be conducted through passive means, such as searching online sources and social media, to collect publicly available information.

3.	Enumeration: Enumeration is the process of actively probing the target network to identify live hosts, open ports, and services running on those ports. This step involves techniques like port scanning, service version detection, and network mapping to gather detailed information about the target environment.

4.	Vulnerability Analysis: Once enumeration is complete, the penetration tester analyzes the identified services and software versions to determine potential vulnerabilities. This may involve using automated scanning tools and manual inspection to assess the security posture of the target systems.

5.	Exploitation: In this phase, the penetration tester attempts to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within the target environment. Exploitation techniques may vary depending on the nature of the vulnerabilities discovered during the vulnerability analysis phase.

6.	Post-exploitation: After gaining access to the target systems, the penetration tester explores the compromised environment to assess the impact of the successful exploit. This may involve collecting sensitive information, pivoting to other systems, or establishing persistence within the network.

7.	Reporting: The final step of the penetration test involves documenting the findings, including the vulnerabilities discovered, exploitation techniques used, and recommendations for remediation. The penetration test report provides valuable insights to the organization's stakeholders and helps prioritize security improvements.
